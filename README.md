# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
I was given the assignment to create a summary DataFrame for the ride sharing data based on city type and to create a line graph showing the total weekly fares for each.

## Results
In the results I found that in both Rural and Suburban areas there were more rides than drivers; however, in the urban area there were more drivers than rides. Because, of this discrepancy even though the urban area had the most amount of fare revenue both of its averages per driver and ride were lower than the other two city types (Suburban and Rural)

Looking at the line graph that tracked total fares by city type it is clear that urban brought in the most, suburban second most, and rural least amount of fares each week. Rural broke never brought in more than 500 dollars in a week worth of fares. Suburban never broke $1,500 in a week. Urban capped out at $2,500 in a week.

## Summary
Three changes that could be made to help the company. One would be to decrease the amount of drivers in the urban area. In both suburban and rural area there is an average ratio of 7 drivers per 10 rides and in the urban area there are 3 drivers for every 2 rides or 15 drivers per 10 rides. the second business decision would be to increase the number of drivers in suburban areas because in the line graph it showed that it had only one peak at $1,500 per week unlike the other city types who hit their peaks multiple times. A lack of drivers is a possibility of what is holding back the potential profits because there might not be enough drivers during peak times. The third business decision is increasing the amount of rural drivers. It has the least amount of drivers to rides ratio and has the most amount of revenue per driver, so if you had more drivers there would be less wait time meaning better service, and hopefully leading to more business.
